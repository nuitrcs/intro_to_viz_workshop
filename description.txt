Intro to Visualization
Frank Elavsky, Data Visualization Specialist, Research Computing Services
This interactive, fun tutorial is focused on best practices when visualizing quantitative data. The participants first will be given an overview of what "visual literacy" is, as well as some important terms and concepts related to visualization. Then the participants interact and follow along as they figure out how to identify 'bad' charts and graphs fix them to make them more effective. This workshop is geared towards anyone who wants to communicate their data and leave a meaningful impact on their audience or anyone who is curious about how to design effective visual communication for data. The participants are expected to bring their own laptops and have Microsoft Excel (or a comparable spreadsheet program) installed. There will be some hands-on visualization building in this course!
